This is an educational app aimed at sixth form students to learn more about the physics of an LED.

It includes simulated experiments, classes with animations and links to more external content. A perfect introduction to the physics of gallium nitride for anyone keen to learn more about semiconductors. 

This app is in Beta and has a lot more content we're working on. Please explore our work so far, we would love your feedback!
